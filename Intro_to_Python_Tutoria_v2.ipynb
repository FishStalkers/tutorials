        "There are two main types of loops in Python, the for loop and the while loop. The for loop executes one time FOR every time a condition is true, while a while loop executes WHILE a condition remains true. The similarities between the two should be apparent. Typically a for loop is used when we know how many times we want to run a block of code (ex. 5 times, or once FOR every element in a list), while a while loop is used when we want to run a block of code, until something happens (ex. continue running NBA season simulations UNTIL the Knicks win a championship). Obviously these are not hard restrictions (we could run a block of code once FOR each element in a list or keep running it WHILE we have more elements in the list (until we run out of elements)), but it's a solid guideline to follow."
