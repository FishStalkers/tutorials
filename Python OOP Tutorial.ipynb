They would have the same attributes (e.g. height, weight, sex, eye color, clothing, etc.), but may have different values for each of these attributes. Here, Derek and Angela are two different objects, but both derive their archetypes from the Person class. It's easy to see the advantage of creating a class. We can easily create plenty of people without having to continuously redefine our attributes for each person. We do the heavy-lifting one time when creating the class, and then simply input our values for each object of the class when defining that object."
